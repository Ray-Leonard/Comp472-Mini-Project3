Project Goal:
To use word embeddings to solve a Synonym test automatically and see if deep learning models could achieve
better performance than human does, and to compare performance of different training models for understanding
factors that affect word embedding
The project  has the following steps:
 Step 1: Install and include Gemsin library and all the training models
 Step 2: Apply the training models on the synonym test. If any of words of the test are not trained, the models will guess the answer.
 Otherwise,they will compare similarity of solution words and choose the word that has the highest similarity, and we will check if the model-choosing
 words match those answer provided.At the end, we will calculate the performance of each model.
 Step 3: Output and evaluate the performance of models in analysis.csv.

Thank You. Have a good one!
